# C++ Login System

This is a simple terminal-based login system written in C++. Users can sign up for an account, log in, reset their password, and quit the program, with user information stored in a text file. 

## How to Use

To use the program, compile the code using a C++ compiler and run the resulting executable file in a terminal or command prompt. Follow the prompts to sign up, login, reset your password, or quit the program. Usernames and passwords are stored in a text file called "users.txt" in the same directory as the program.

## File Structure

The code consists of a single file, "login.cpp". When compiled, this file creates an executable program called "login".

## Dependencies

This code requires a C++ compiler to compile and run.

## Limitations

This code is a simple implementation of a login system and is not intended for production use. It has several limitations, including:

- Passwords are encrypted using a simple hashing function that is not secure.
- Usernames and passwords are stored in a text file that can be easily accessed and modified.
- There is no mechanism for password recovery or account deletion.
- The user interface is basic and does not include any error handling or input validation.

## Future Work

Possible future work on this code could include:

- Implementing more secure password hashing and storage mechanisms.
- Storing user information in a database instead of a text file.
- Adding features such as password recovery and account deletion.
- Improving the user interface with error handling and input validation.
